v109 — Cognitive Observation Events

This version introduces the first dedicated cognitive observation engine.

New capabilities:

• Detects cognitive events directly from reflection language

• Identifies:

  - Outcome concern

  - Verification attempt

  - Self-monitoring

  - Relief / reassurance

• Observation events now include Cognitive category entries

• Reflection Summary is generated from detected cognitive sequences

• Correlation engine now uses cognitive observations

• Dynamics engine now recognizes:

  - Resolution seeking

  - Active checking

• Timeline and detail views display cognitive observations

Example sequence:

Outcome concern → Verification attempt → Relief / reassurance

v110 — Reflection Arc Engine

Implemented:

- Reflection Arc Engine

Capabilities:

- Detects beginning → middle → end cognitive movement

- Builds narrative reflection sequences from cognitive events

- Identifies:

  - Concern → Verification → Reassurance

  - Concern → Verification

  - Verification → Reassurance

  - Monitoring → Resolution

- Generates Reflection Arc summaries

- Produces user-facing "What's Going On" explanations

- Generates Suggested Direction guidance

- Introduces simplified consumer-facing Observatory view

Example Arc:

Concern → Verification → Reassurance

Example Interpretation:

"The reflection appears to begin with concern about a possible problem, move into checking or verification, and end with reassurance or acceptance."

Tag: v110

Date: 2026-06-17




Implemented:

• Insight-first user interface
• Simplified Reflection Detail screen
• Simplified Observatory screen
• Evidence-first architecture
• Diagnostics moved below primary insights

Design Goals:

• Present meaning before mechanics
• Reduce cognitive overload
• Preserve analyst-level detail
• Support both casual and expert users
• Prepare for future biometric and clinical data integration

New Structure:

What’s Going On
↓
Reflection Arc
↓
Suggested Direction
↓
Evidence (collapsed)
↓
Diagnostics (collapsed)

Key Principle:

Users should first understand what appears to be happening before seeing how the system reached its conclusions.

Future Direction:

• Biometric correlation
• Speaker identity
• Longitudinal patterns
• Clinical signal integration
• Meaning engine

v112 — Observatory Source of Truth & Roadmap

Implemented:

• Added project constraints, glossary, and pre-build checklist as the architecture baseline
• Added revised requirements and roadmap document
• Established the required implementation order: durable data foundation before new feature-specific engines
• Established rules for modularity, provenance, evidence traceability, non-diagnostic language, and scalable signal sources

Tag: v112

Date: 2026-06-24


v113 — Signal Library Foundation

Implemented:

• Added modular SignalLibrary and SignalDetectionRule data models
• Added versioned, inspectable library metadata: IDs, versions, author, domain, tags, confidence, enabled state, and notes
• Added generic SignalLibraryDetectionEngine
• Migrated CognitiveObservationDetector to read cognitive rules through the generic library engine
• Added initial Observatory Cognitive Core library
• Added evidence provenance to generated observations:
  - library ID
  - library version
  - rule ID
  - rule domain
  - matched phrase
  - engine version
• Added Signal Library inspection screen

Important:

• v113 moved cognitive phrase/pattern criteria out of scattered detector logic and into a reusable library structure.
• The initial library remained compiled seed data; it was not yet persistent storage or a user-importable database.

Tag: v113

Date: 2026-06-24


v114 — Persistent Signal Library Store

Implemented:

• Added PersistentSignalLibraryStore
• Added local JSON-backed persistence in the app’s protected Application Support storage
• Seeded the Observatory Cognitive Core library into local storage on first launch
• Updated SignalLibraryRegistry to load and manage persisted libraries
• Updated SignalLibraryDetectionEngine and CognitiveObservationDetector to read enabled libraries from the persistent local store
• Added local enable/disable control and export-preview inspection to SignalLibraryScreen
• Added persistent-store provenance tag:
  - store:persistent-local

Architecture status:

• Signal libraries are now persisted locally on-device rather than existing only as compiled-in runtime defaults.
• The compiled default library remains as seed/fallback data for first launch and recovery.
• The runtime detector now reads persisted enabled libraries.

Not yet implemented:

• File-picker import/export workflow
• Library authoring/editing UI
• Third-party library validation, signatures, moderation, licensing, or conflict handling
• Cloud sync or remote database
• Migration of every existing detector to library-backed rules
• Biometrics, speaker identity, clinical data, or diagnostic logic
